# Algorithmic Trading Platform

This project is an implementation of an algorithmic trading platform developed in C++. The platform includes various components such as an order book, market data handler, risk management system, strategy execution engine, logging, and a simulation and backtesting framework. The project is designed to test and evaluate trading strategies using historical market data.

## Components

1. **OrderBook**: Handles orders and matches buy and sell orders.
